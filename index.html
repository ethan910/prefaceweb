    <ol>
 		<li>For every item bought in preface.We donate  8 dollars to team seas. If u dont know whats team seas it  is a donation to remove 1 pound of trash for $1 us.If you want  to donate yourself you can click on the teamseas logo.</li>
 		<li>We will have three bins maybe made out of cardboard one for plastic one for glass one for paper so we can recyle stuff.
 		<li>
		We can use metal straws or paper straws. We can reuse metal straws and for paper straws we can place it in the paper recycle bin.
